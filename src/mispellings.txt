Interest in robotics is increasing in many parts of the world, and developing countries are no exeption.Â  From research projects aimed at developing novel robotic systems for unique challenges, to education and outreach progrm that use robotics to enhance students' interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) fields, the collection of robotics projects in developing countries provides a fascinating panorama of the potentl and impact robotics can have around the world. 

A session at the conference will be specifically dedicated to highlighting robotics work in developing countries. An interactive display at the conference will feature information on a diverse array of robotics projects in developing ountries around the world. Work from a wide range of categories will be featured, including but not lemeted to research, education, outreach, academic work, industry work, governmental work, and NGO work.
